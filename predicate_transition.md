# Predicate transition
## Introduction
Given a query, the database application parses it into an abstract syntax tree(AST), based on which an execution plan is then generated. 

An execution plan is of tree structure; similar to the magma flow during volcanic eruption, data is generated by the leaf node and flows towards the root.
When a non-leaf tree node receives data from its child, it applies some manipulation over it, such as filter out some lines(Selection), 
removing or adding extra columns(Projection), or matching rows between two children(Join). After that, the modified data is returned to its father node.
The whole process is similar to the lava flow during volcanic eruption, data moves from below to above and when the root node returns, the output is send to the client as the query result.

Usually, the execution plan derived from AST(raw plan) is just a verbatim translation of the query -- it yeilds the correct output but fails to take into account the execution cost.
In fact, some optimization can be apply to the raw plan to achieve a shorter execution time while maintaning the correctness of the result, for instance, 
join reordering, which changes the join order when more than two tables are joined together, or column pruning, which removes unused columns from the output of each
tree node, in a way reducing the amount of data transaferred among nodes. Here i'd like to share my views on a common but crucial optimization method -- predicate transtition.

## Outline
In this passage, i would firstly give a brief introduction of tranditional predicate push down, and then the concept of predication transition.
After that, some selective plan nodes are introduced, on which we discuss how to perform predicate transition. Finally, some drawbacks and limitations are covered.

## Concept of Predicate Transition

Predication transtition is an advanced version of traditional predicate push down, a tranditional optimizing strategy pushing filter conditions, i.e. predicates, downtowards into
to the leaf nodes.
Predicate pushdown must be introduced beforehand
